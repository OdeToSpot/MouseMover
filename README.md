# MouseMover
Jiggles the mouse a bit to keep your windows laptop from going to sleep

# Reason
Needed a way to keep my laptop from locking because due to some access issues, if my laptop locked whilst conected to VPN, I could not log back in until I killed the wifi signal.

# Notes
Got the idea from https://code.joejag.com/2013/move-your-mouse-pointer-with-java.html, but added tweaks so that it would only move the mouse 1 pixel diagnolly.  

# Compile
`javac MouseMover.java`
